# RL Broadcast Overlay

Built to be used with BakkesMod (for RocketLeague) with the SOS Relay plugin installed and running on the same network.
Includes scenes for pre-game, during game, during replays, and post-game podium. Team names auto-update based on names set in-game, all player info (name, boost) will automatically be updated whenever needed once gameplay begins and updated in real-time as the game is played.
