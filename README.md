# RL Broadcast Overlay
An overlay for Rocket League E-Sports broadcasts built with Svelte. Dynamically updates with live in-game information, displaying it in an easy-to-digest format for new or knowledgeable players.

Includes scenes for pre-game, during game, during replays, and post-game podium. Team names auto-update based on names set in-game, all player info (name, boost) will automatically be updated whenever needed once gameplay begins and updated in real-time as the game is played.
Built to be used with BakkesMod (for RocketLeague) with the SOS Relay plugin installed and running on the same network.
